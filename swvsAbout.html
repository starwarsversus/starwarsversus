	  	<h1>A little about <br>Star Wars Versus...</h1>
	  		<p><br>Hey! My name is Eddie, and I am the creator and administrator of this account. Back in 2017, I was going out to eat with my parents to a sports bar, and it bothered me, that I wanted to talk to people about who would win in a duel between Clone Wars Darth Maul and Prime Darth Vader. I have fun random thoughts, not all awe-inspiring, but that's what got this idea started believe it or not.<br><br>
	  		I hopped on Instagram to find that there were no active Star Wars Versus battle accounts, and those that did exist, were REALLY small. So, I decided that I would create a Star Wars account, with only the intention of asking people who they thought would win the battle.<br><br>
	  		To my surprise, a lot of people WERE INTERESTED and wanted this type of community just like me on Instagram, so I decided to be the guy to pioneer Instagram's largest versus battle community. I reached out and networked with other popular Star Wars accounts, as well as trying to produce interesting content and thought-provoking fights.<br><br>
	  		It was a success. I jumped form 13 followers to 50, from 50 to 150, from 150 to 500, from 500 to 800, from 800 to thousands, hitting +13,000 followers. My account blew up with the creation of story-based battles, Star Wars content reviews, and versus tournaments. It was insane. At one point, I was consistently averaging 400,000 views (Instagram insights) per week, for months. Keep in mind, I was a high school student and approaching graduation. I had huge goals, trying to maintain a 3.9+ GPA, as well as involvement outside of my classes. I wanted to go to an Ivy League School. It was pretty hard to juggle everything, but ya know, I loved this account and community. It meant a lot to create a nice community like this, and I felt so loyal to keeping up my account.<br><br>
	  		However, when I graduated high school and would go to college, I felt it best to leave social media altogether, including Star Wars Versus. Social media has its ups and downs, but the summer before I went to college, I felt like social media was just a drag emotionally and socially. I couldn't enjoy the 'natural' world as much and felt socially isolated. It was nice being away from all social media accounts I had for as long as I did, but when COVID-19 hit, I began to really miss my time as the admin of such a wonderful community. It was an honor to be "Mr. Star Wars Versus". I wanted to 'save' the year in a way, as COVID brutalized most hopes of a fun 2020, so I came back to a warm welcome from the community I loved so much.<br><br>
	  		Fast-forward to now, I have coded this website you're looking at now, using HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript, with the intention of archiving my best work for all time. I have also created a discord for the community and a star wars-specific email to reach me at. I created online payment accounts as well to take tips and donations from my most passionate supporters.<br><br>
	  		Unfortunatley this dream can not last forever. But... I will prolong my sleep for as long as I can. I have created alternative ways of engaging with me beyond Instagram, as I do plan on leaving very soon forever, definitely by the end of the summer. Thank you for all your support! Please donate as a parting gift if you would be so inclined. As Uma Gun Di said, let's make the end memorable.
